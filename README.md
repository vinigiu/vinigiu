# Welcome!
 
## I'm Vin√≠cius Giuseppe Guida!
 
For 7 years, I worked as a soccer coach in the youth divisions of a major Brazilian club. This experience enriched me in various ways. Amidst victories and defeats, I was able to learn a lot about leadership, teamwork, and the power of daily hard work, values that I have carried with me ever since and seek to apply in any work environment. This experience also enabled me to develop problem-solving skills and a focus on results.

My passion for technology and its possibilities led me to choose the path of Development. Since March 2022, I have been working as a Full-Stack Web Developer. I am passionate about learning and the pursuit of knowledge, always seeking new experiences that can contribute to my professional and personal growth.

I greatly enjoy encountering a problem that needs to be solved, one that requires me to use tools I already have and to search for new tools that I am not yet familiar with to resolve it.

I develop personal projects on my GitHub, where I use technologies such as Node.js, Typescript, Express, Next.js, Postgres, MySQL, React, HTML, EJS, CSS, JWT, among others.
